A Python-based educational tool demonstrating brute force and dictionary-based password cracking techniques for cybersecurity education.

## ⚠️ Educational Purposes Only ⚠️

This tool is designed for **educational purposes only** to demonstrate password security concepts. Using this tool against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical.

## Overview

This tool demonstrates three common password cracking techniques:

1. **Pure Brute Force**: Systematically tries all possible character combinations
2. **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a wordlist (like rockyou.txt) of common passwords
3. **Targeted Wordlist Attack**: Uses personalized wordlists generated from user information

The demonstration helps students understand:
- Why strong passwords matter
- How password cracking works
- The computational resources required for attacks
- Why hash functions are used (and their limitations)
- How personal information can be exploited to guess passwords

## Features

- Brute force attacks with customizable character sets
- Dictionary attacks using popular wordlists
- Support for user-based password lists generated by CUPP
- Support for common hash algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- Interactive mode for classroom demonstrations
- Performance metrics (attempts per second, elapsed time)
- Progress reporting for longer attacks

## Components

This repository includes two main tools:

1. **brute-force.py**: The password cracking demonstration tool
2. **cupp-generator.py**: A tool to generate targeted password lists based on personal information

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No additional packages required (uses standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. No additional installation required

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/brute-force-demo.git
cd brute-force-demo
```

## Usage

### Brute Force Tool Basic Usage

```bash

```bash
python cupp-generator.py -i
```

### Command Line Arguments for Brute Force Tool

#### Target Options (required, choose one)
- `-p, --password TEXT` - Target password to crack
- `-i, --interactive` - Input password interactively (hidden input)
- `-H, --hash TEXT` - Target password hash to crack

#### Attack Type Options
- `-b, --brute-force` - Use brute force attack (default)
- `-w, --wordlist FILE` - Use dictionary attack with the specified wordlist file
- `-c, --cupp FILE` - Use a wordlist generated by CUPP or similar user-info based generators

#### Character Set Options (for brute force)
- `-l, --lowercase` - Use lowercase letters (a-z)
- `-u, --uppercase` - Use uppercase letters (A-Z)
- `-d, --digits` - Use digits (0-9)
- `-s, --symbols` - Use special symbols (!@#$, etc.)

#### Additional Options
- `-m, --max-length INT` - Maximum password length to try (default: 4)
- `-a, --algorithm [md5|sha1|sha256]` - Hash algorithm (default: sha256)

### Command Line Arguments for CUPP Generator

- `-i, --interactive` - Run in interactive mode (gather information through prompts)
- `-f, --file FILE` - Use a configuration file to generate passwords

## Attack Examples

### Brute Force Examples

```bash
# Crack a simple password using lowercase letters
python brute-force.py -p "abc" -l

# Crack a more complex password with mixed character sets
python brute-force.py -p "P4s$" -l -u -d -s -m 4

# Crack a password hash (SHA256)
python brute-force.py -H "5e884898da28047151d0e56f8dc6292773603d0d6aabbdd62a11ef721d1542d8" -l -d -m 6

# Interactive mode (password not visible)
python brute-force.py -i -l -u -d
```

### Dictionary Attack Examples

```bash
# Crack using rockyou.txt wordlist
python brute-force.py -p "password123" -w /path/to/rockyou.txt

# Crack a hash using a wordlist
python brute-force.py -H "5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8" -a sha1 -w /path/to/rockyou.txt
```

### User-Based Password Attack Examples

```bash
# First generate a targeted wordlist with CUPP
python cupp-generator.py -i
# (answer the interactive questions about the target)

# Then use the generated wordlist with the brute force tool
python brute-force.py -p "Summer2022!" -c passwords.txt

# Crack a hash with user-specific wordlist
python brute-force.py -H "5baa61e4c9b93f3f0682250b6cf8331b7ee68fd8" -a sha1 -c passwords.txt
```

## CUPP Generator: How It Works

The CUPP (Common User Passwords Profiler) tool generates potential passwords based on personal information. It works by:

1. Collecting information about the target through interactive prompts:
   - Names (first, last, nicknames)
   - Birth dates
   - Partner and children information
   - Pet names
   - Company name
   - Other keywords (hobbies, interests, etc.)

2. Creating password variations using:
   - Name combinations
   - Capitalization variations
   - Leet speak substitutions (a→4, e→3, etc.)
   - Common number patterns
   - Date formats
   - Special character additions

3. Generating a comprehensive wordlist file that can then be used with the brute force tool

This demonstrates the vulnerability of using personal information in passwords and why password policies often prohibit such practices.

## Educational Applications

### Classroom Demonstrations

1. **Password Strength**: Show how quickly weak passwords can be cracked
   ```bash
   python brute-force.py -p "1234" -d -m 4
   ```

2. **Character Set Complexity**: Demonstrate how larger character sets increase security
   ```bash
   # Compare these two runs:
   python brute-force.py -p "a9b" -l -d -m 3
   python brute-force.py -p "a9b" -l -u -d -s -m 3
   ```

3. **Password Length**: Show how length increases cracking time exponentially
   ```bash
   # Compare these two runs:
   python brute-force.py -p "pass" -l -m 4
   python brute-force.py -p "passw" -l -m 5
   ```

4. **Common Password Vulnerability**: Show why dictionary attacks are so effective
   ```bash
   python brute-force.py -p "password123" -w rockyou.txt
   ```

5. **Personal Information Risk**: Demonstrate how using personal details makes passwords vulnerable
   ```bash
   # Generate a wordlist for a fictitious person
   python cupp-generator.py -i
   # Then crack their password
   python brute-force.py -p "Mike2010!" -c passwords.txt
   ```

### Teaching Topics

- Basic cryptography concepts
- Password hashing and salting
- Computational complexity
- Security best practices
- Ethical hacking principles
- Social engineering and OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)
- Password policy design

## Finding and Using Wordlists

### rockyou.txt

The rockyou.txt wordlist is commonly used for educational purposes. You can find it:

1. On Kali Linux at `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz` (may need to gunzip it)
2. In various security education repositories
3. For educational purposes only: [SecLists repository](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)

### CUPP-Generated Lists

The CUPP generator included in this repository creates custom wordlists based on personal information. This demonstrates a more targeted approach that attackers might use against specific individuals.

## Extending the Tool

Ideas for students to extend this demo:
- Add rainbow table attacks
- Implement password salting
- Add multi-threading for faster cracking
- Create a hybrid attack (dictionary + patterns)
- Add a GUI interface
- Enhance the CUPP generator with additional pattern recognition
- Implement more advanced social engineering techniques
